      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Jared, and I have been fascinated with code all my life -
        I got my start hacking on the Half-Life video game's SDK when I was in
        high school! I was born with a love for solving puzzles and exploring
        the unknown. I am a California native, and despite enduring almost 30
        summers here, I am glad to call this state my home.
      </p>
      <p>
        After trying out some entry level jobs and an indulgence of my curiosity
        toward the manual trades, I discovered and enrolled in the Lambda
        programming school. After six months of instruction and work based on
        Agile methodology, I have become very proficient in navigating the
        industry's Git-based workflow and frequent face-to-face meetings. I have
        enjoyed every moment, and I believe that the individuals at Lambda are
        at the top of their field as hands-on educators, instilling graduates
        with the specific work and communication skills that they will need
        master to succeed.
      </p>

        I am excited by the many divergent paths taken by the tech community,
        pursuing different sectors of the economy and everyday life, allowing
        developers a great amount of choice in how their efforts are applied to
        the surface of society. I am particularly interested in the fields of
        security, blockchain histories, and economics. I feel that the software
        developed in the next 20 years may decide the winners of the global
        economy, and cause either a great increase or decrease in personal
        economic freedom. My greatest dream is to be on the side of the people
        in this arena, perhaps developing decentralized banking software, or an
        international news site with a literally impeccable record of events.
